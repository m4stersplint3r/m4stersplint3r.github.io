        <h1>Welcome, you can learn more about me than you ever cared to know!</h1>

        <h2>These are random thoughts</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <lh class="blogDate">10/31/2020</lh>
        <li>I wish the world were the type of place where kids could run around neighborhoods without needing to worry about them. The existence of evil people puts a large damper on things for normal people who do not seek to harm others.</li>
        <lh class="blogDate">11/02/2020</lh>
        <li>I once bought a potato with the intention of making French Fries, instead I just baked the potato and covered it with butter. Such a versatile little vegetable.</li>
        <lh class="blogDate">11/05/2020</lh>
        <li>Everyone is spending their entire day just looking at the map. Waiting to see what color their state will turn. The color is a big deciding factor nationally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>This is what goes through my head while developing</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <lh class="blogDate">10/14/2020</lh>
        <li>Today is the start of a new direction in my life.</li>
        <lh class="blogDate">10/18/2020</lh>
        <li>So far so good, nothing is going over my head... yet.</li>
        <lh class="blogDate">10/24/2020</lh>
        <li>Lots of prior knowledge is being solidifed now. This is great.</li>

        <li>Object Oriented Programming is fun!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>I was raised in Detroit, Michigan until I was in the 4th grade. During my 4th grade year my family moved to Westland where I would spend the remainder of my childhood. I fell in love with street hockey in that new neighborhood and made great friends.</p>
